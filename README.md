### Troubleshooting
* If a professor's ratings don't show in student registration, go to the [Professor Database](https://github.com/AdvaitPaliwal/rate-my-professors-wayne-state/blob/main/professors.js) and search for their first or last name. 
* If there are no results, they don't exist on https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/.
